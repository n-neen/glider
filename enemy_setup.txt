enemy setup

if any enemy routine pointer = 0 then it is ignored

balloon: {
    property = speed
        XYYY, where
        X = pixels per frame
        YYY = 0.YYY0
        
    palette bitmask high byte (properties 2)
        timer for respawn
        ff00 = 00ff frames
}

duct: {
    palette bitmask high byte (properties 2)
        $8000 bit = floor or ceiling duct
        
    property
        00ff
        low byte = room index to travel to
        
        ff00
        high byte = output x position
}

battery: {
    property
        amount of battery time
}

switch: {
    properties2 (enemypal)
        $1000 bit = boolean for not hitting constantly (once per room)
        $0200 bit = spritemap selection
    property
        data for target (its property)
    property3
        target for switch:
            aabb, where
            aa = room index
            bb = enemy or object target
                $01 bit of bb = select object (0 = enemy)
                all indices are even numbers so if it's odd, it's object index+1
    enemyvariable
        spritemap select
            0000 = on
            0002 = off

}

all prizes: {
    property3:
        item index bit
        each room gets one word, so a room can only have 16 prizes
        each item gets one bit and it must be unique
