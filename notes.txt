MAIN GAMEPLAY
            if [two player game] ( do stuff )
            else
            ( do the same stuff but only with one player)
            so gameplay is more like
                        HandleDynamics();
                        if (!gameOver)
                        {
                            if (demoGoing)
                                GetDemoInput(&theGlider);
                            else
                                GetInput(&theGlider);
                            HandleInteraction();
                        }
                        HandleTriggers();
                        HandleBands();
                        if (!gameOver)
                            HandleGlider(&theGlider);
            dynamics means enemies or other objects that move
            bands are your weapons
            glider is the player character
            triggers are an object type like switches for tuning off and on lights and other objects
            so:
                                    handle enemies,
                                    handle interaction,
                                    handle switches,
                                    handle rubber bands,
                                    handle glider
            also has
             
                    gameFrame++;
                    evenFrame = !evenFrame;
             way up the function
             
             
             
             
             
             
             
boot
init registers etc
clear wram
load level
init enemies
init glider
             
gameplay loop:                                                                  play.c
    while (!quitting) && (playing):
        gameFrame++;
        evenFrame = !evenFrame;
        get input,
        handle enemies,
        handle interaction,
        handle switches,
        handle rubber bands,
        handle glider
                giant switch case statement for every movement in               player.c
        if (playing)
            renderframe
        if (gameover)
            dogameover
            
essentials:
    display any background at all           ;start here
    basic glider sprites                    ;and then this
    multi-screen levels
        some kind of level format
    basic enemies
        dart
        balloon
    basic furniture
    original assets massaged to fit
    
nice to have:
    hud
    splash screen
    all enemy types
    all furniture types
    all object types
        incl. grease
    all backgrounds
    level data compression
    transport ducts
    switches
    lighting
    candles [+glider can catch on fire]
    
stretch:
    level data compatibility
    high res mode?
    animated screen transition like original
